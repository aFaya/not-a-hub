I've ask a question at zhihu [In what ways can improve the collaboration between Vue and TypeScript](https://www.zhihu.com/question/302221630). This is list of resources that describes the typing of vue, the author is a member of Vue core team, and have exprienced in TypeScript. With these posts, I known the reason for the difficulty of typing Vue in TypeScript (properly everything is bounded to the giant `this` in Vue). Some of these may not hold any more with the revolution of both libraries.
