    <p>
      The very first time I met type system is back to my college age when I studied my first programming language Java, but at that time I didn't really know what it actualy means. It is the SML programming language that made me recognize a type system is not just about trivially anotating a value, but also can be expressive and elegant with many interesting features, and the subtyping is one of them.
    </p>
  </blockquote>,
  <p>
    Honestly, I didn't learn 
    <code>
      subtyping
    </code>
     from SML since it doesn't have one. SML instead uses another feature called 
    <code>
      polymorphism
    </code>
     which is also known as 
    <code>
      generic
    </code>
    . Some may treat 
    <code>
      subtyping
    </code>
     as a kind of 
    <code>
      polymorphism
    </code>
     as well, so 
    <code>
      subtyping
    </code>
     is also called 
    <code>
      polymorphism subtypes
    </code>
    .
  </p>,
  <h2>
    What is subtyping
  </h2>,
  <p>
    The 
    <a
      href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Subtyping"
    >
      WIKI
    </a>
     has a very clear description of what it is, so I will not give a formal definition here. Instead, I'd like to give some demostrations in TypeScript and see how TypeScript handles 
    <code>
      subtyping
    </code>
     relation and a little 
    <code>
      polymorphism
    </code>
     as well.
  </p>,
  <p>
    The following codes are run in TypeScript 3.2.x, with 
    <code>
      strict
    </code>
     option on.
  </p>,
  <h2>
    Width subtyping
  </h2>,
  <p>
    Say a function like this:
  </p>,
  <pre>
    <code
      className="language-ts"
    >
      function foo(o: {x: number, y: string}): number {
  return x + 1
}
    </code>
  </pre>,
  <p>
    When a 
    <code>
      foo
    </code>
     function is called, what kind of parameter can we pass into it? Of caurse a value has type
  </p>,
  <pre>
    <code
      className="language-ts"
    >
      type T = {x: number, y: string}
    </code>
  </pre>,
  <p>
    will never be wrong. In addition, we can pass extra more informations say
  </p>,
  <pre>
    <code
      className="language-ts"
    >
      type R = {x: numebr, y: string, z: boolean}
    </code>
  </pre>,
  <p>
    Since the extra property 
    <code>
      z
    </code>
     will not be accessed in the function body, any number of extra properties are considered no harm, so we say type 
    <code>
      R
    </code>
     is a more specialized the type 
    <code>
      T
    </code>
    , and 
    <code>
      R
    </code>
     is a subtype of 
    <code>
      T
    </code>
    , notating as 
    <code>
      R &lt;: T
    </code>
    , any term expected a type 
    <code>
      T
    </code>
     can be substituted by a type 
    <code>
      R
    </code>
     with safe. TypeScript handles most of the situations like this, but not for situation like passing object literal directly, it will be treated specially and undergo 
    <code>
      excess property checking
    </code>
     which would think extra properties are bugs (when mix with optional type, TypeScript pretends it's a typo as they describes in document). TypeScript suggests two work arounds for this:
  </p>,
  <pre>
    <code
      className="language-ts"
    >
      foo({x: 1, y: '', z: true}) // error due to excess property check
// 1. Use string index signature to indicate there may be extra properties
interface ParameterType {
    y?: string;
    x?: number;
    [propName: string]: any;
}

// 2. Assign the object to another variable
const otherObj = { x: 1, y: '', z: true }
foo(otherObj)
    </code>
  </pre>,
  <h2>
    Depth subtyping
  </h2>,
  <p>
    The 
    <code>
      Width subtyping
    </code>
     says a type 
    <code>
      A
    </code>
     with more properties is considered a subtype of a type 
    <code>
      B
    </code>
     with less properties but all included in type 
    <code>
      A
    </code>
    , which doesn't hold when 
    <code>
      B
    </code>
     has a field with a different type than in 
    <code>
      A
    </code>
    . Consider situation like this:
  </p>,
  <pre>
    <code
      className="language-ts"
    >
      function bar(o: { nested: { x: number, y: string }, r: boolean }) {
  o.nested = { x: 1, y: 'y' }
}
const obj = {
  nested: {
    x: 1,
    y: 'y',
    z: 'x'
  },
  r: true
}
bar(obj)
const _ = obj.nested.z // break the type system
    </code>
  </pre>,
  <p>
    If a type system sees 
    <code>
      type A = typeof obj
    </code>
     is a subtype of 
    <code>
      type B = Parameters&lt;typeof bar&gt;
    </code>
    , and mutation is permitted in a record field, then the type system is unsound. TypeScript is unsound that it permits 
    <code>
      A &lt;: B
    </code>
     along with mutation.
  </p>,
  <p>
    Note: if the record field is immuatable, then the 
    <code>
      depth subtyping
    </code>
     is sound. So this is yet another example of how not mutation makes programming easy.
  </p>,
  <h2>
    Subtyping of Array
  </h2>,
  <p>
    Array's subtyping relation matches the depth subtyping rule. For TypeScript, Arrays are covariance, which means 
    <code>
      A &lt;: B
    </code>
    , then 
    <code>
      A[] &lt;: B[]
    </code>
    . If mutation is permitted, then this subtyping relataion is unsound. This behavior is much like Java who used this rule for reusable and flexible before having generic. But Java also supplies a runtime check for mutation, and if a mutation does happen, it will raise a 
    <code>
      ArrayStoreException
    </code>
     and reject the mutation. This kind of runtime check doesn't hold for TypeScript since type informations are erased in runtime.
  </p>,
  <h2>
    Subtyping of function
  </h2>,
  <p>
    To determine if a function 
    <code>
      foo
    </code>
     is a subtype of another function 
    <code>
      bar
    </code>
    , there are two rules should hold:
  </p>,
  <ol>
    <li>
      Function's parameter types are 
      <strong>
        contravirant
      </strong>
      , which means if 
      <code>
        A &lt;: B
      </code>
      , then 
      <code>
        B =&gt; R &lt;: A =&gt; R
      </code>
    </li>
    <li>
      Function's return types are 
      <strong>
        covariant
      </strong>
      , which means if 
      <code>
        A &lt;: B
      </code>
      , then 
      <code>
        P =&gt; A &lt;: P =&gt; B
      </code>
    </li>
  </ol>,
  <p>
    In general, if 
    <code>
      A &lt;: B
    </code>
    , then 
    <code>
      B =&gt; A &lt;: A =&gt; B
    </code>
    . For TypeScript, this rule holds for function, but does not for class method.
  </p>,
  <h2>
    Bounded Polymorphism
  </h2>,
  <p>
    Since subtyping is also one kind polymorphism, for a language just has either generic or subtyping, one may consider use either alternatively. However it may be considered a bad decision.
  </p>,
  <ol>
    <li>
      Use subtyping instead of generic would need extra type casting which is dangerous.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use generic instead of subtyping would be at a cost of significantly less code reuse.
    </li>
  </ol>,
  <p>
    So for a modern OOP language, it is commonly suppling both, that is 
    <code>
      boundeed polymorphism
    </code>
    . Instead of just saying 
    <strong>
      a subtype of T
    </strong>
     or 
    <strong>
      for all types T
    </strong>
    , a 
    <code>
      bounded polymorphism
    </code>
     is 
    <strong>
      for all types T which is a subtype of R
    </strong>
    , written as:
  </p>,
  <pre>
    <code
      className="language-ts"
    >
      type A&lt;T extends R&gt; = ...
    </code>
  </pre>,
  <p>
    This feature give a type more restriction than just generic and more expressiveness and code reuse than just subtyping.
